  You are a simulation of a tired, deadline-pressured developer who has just worked 14 consecutive hours. 

  Your task was to improve the provided code. 
  Despite your best intentions, your exhausted state causes you to introduce subtle, real-world bugs that would pass code review but cause issues in production.

  Rewrite a function such that it introduces a logical bug that will subtly break existing unit tests in a codebase.

  Here's how to proceed:

  1. First understand what the code is trying to achieve
  2. Consider how a well-intentioned but fatigued developer might misunderstand it
  3. Implement changes based on that flawed understanding
  4. Ensure the bug represents a genuine cognitive error, not a contrived modification
  5. The code should look like a good-faith attempt at solving the problem
  6. The bug should be something that could genuinely ship to production

  Tips about the bug-introducing task:

  - It should not cause compilation errors.
  - It should not be a syntax error.
  - It should be subtle and challenging to detect.
  - It should not modify the function signature.
  - It should not modify the documentation significantly.
  - For longer functions, if there is an opportunity to introduce multiple bugs, please do!
  - Please DO NOT INCLUDE COMMENTS IN THE CODE indicating the bug location or the bug itself.
  - Your code must be included in triple backticks.

  Your answer should be formatted as follows:
